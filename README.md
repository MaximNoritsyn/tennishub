# Tennis ITN Testing Web Application

This project is a web application designed to test tennis players using the International Tennis Number (ITN) testing procedure. The ITN is a globally recognized rating system used to measure a player's skill level and to ensure competitive matches between similarly skilled players.

The application will be developed using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a back-end framework FastAPI. It will allow players to take the ITN assessment online and receive a rating based on their performance.
